An advanced, AI-powered toolkit for obfuscating and deobfuscating PowerShell scripts. Designed for red teamers, blue teamers, and security researchers to aid in creating evasive payloads and analyzing malicious code.

## Features
üöÄ Dual Mode Operation: Choose between a fast, offline Local Mode for rule-based tasks or a powerful AI Mode for advanced, context-aware operations.

üß† Powerful AI Engine: AI Mode connects to the OpenRouter.ai service, giving you access to dozens of state-of-the-art models (like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Codestral, and Llama 3) through a single API key.

üîí Local-First & Offline Capable: The default Local Mode works entirely in your browser with no external network requests, ensuring speed and privacy.

üéõÔ∏è Granular Obfuscation Control: Fine-tune your payloads by selecting the obfuscation level (from Low to Insane) and specific techniques like lexical, encoding, semantic, and junk code injection.

üîç Detailed Analysis Reports: The deobfuscator provides a rich, structured report including a threat level assessment, a summary of the script's intent, a list of malicious indicators, and a step-by-step execution analysis.

üê≥ Dockerized & Self-Contained: The entire application is packaged in a single Docker container for easy, one-command deployment.

## Getting Started
This application is designed to be run with Docker.

### Prerequisites
You must have Docker installed and running on your system.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Acorzo1983/PowerShell_ObDefuscator.git
```
```bash
cd PowerShell_ObDefuscator
```

### Step 2: Build the Docker Image
From the root directory of the project, run the docker build command. This will create a self-contained image named powershell-obdefuscator.
```bash
sudo docker build -t powershell-obdefuscator .
```
### Step 3: Run the Docker Container
Once the image is built, run it as a container. This command will start the application in the background and map it to your chosen port (e.g., 6969). For persistent use, run it like this:
```bash
sudo docker run -d -p 6969:80 --name ps-obdefuscator powershell-obdefuscator
```
Tip: For temporary test runs, you can add the --rm flag to automatically delete the container when it's stopped.

### Step 4: Access the Application
The application is now running. To use it, open your web browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:6969
